## Hey! This is my mdsvex component!

Now this is some content, just because we need to have some content here.

Now comes the fun part, where we either port this layout over to the personal blog project or recreate the functionality of the personal blog here. 

_Or_

We recreate all of it using a different build system like Snowpack.

Either way, I'm liking the look of the typography here. Lots of whitespace and the text is nice and readable. Let's add a code block and see what's what.

```js
const myName = 'Jeff Caldwell';
let currentpursuits = ['Learning JavaScript', 'Studying Computer Science', 'Writing', 'Making Websites'];

async function doSomething(thing) {
    console.log(thing);
} 
```
