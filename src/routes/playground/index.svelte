<h1>CSS Playground</h1>

<p>
  CSS is one of those things that can be described in very dualistic terms. It's
  simple but complex. It's easy, but it's also pretty difficult (at least, once
  a project starts getting complex). In truth, just like with anything having to
  do with web design and development, it's just something that you have to learn
  well enough that you don't drive yourself crazy.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily, once you start to learn some of the intricacies of CSS it starts to
  get pretty fun.
</p>
<p>
  In that spirit, I'm creating a CSS Playground. The idea is to have something
  that gives you immediate feedback when you change a given value. Think of it
  as an interactive cheatsheet.
